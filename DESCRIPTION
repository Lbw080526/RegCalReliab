Description: Implements regression calibration methods for correcting 
    measurement error in regression models using external or internal 
    reliability studies. The package supports continuous, binary, and 
    count outcomes through linear, logistic, and log-linear regression. 
    Sandwich variance estimation is provided to ensure valid inference 
    while accounting for the additional uncertainty from calibration. 
    Tools for formula parsing, calibration modeling, and simulation 
    studies are included to facilitate reproducible analysis in 
    epidemiologic and biomedical research.
